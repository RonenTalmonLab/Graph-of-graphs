The code in this repository creates the images presented in figure 7 of this article: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.263467v1.full.pdf

The code was developed and tested in Matlab R2020a.

## Activation
* Run the script 'Localization_Simulation_1.m' in order to create the simulation results appearing in the upper images.
* Run the script 'Localization_Simulation_2.m' in order to create the simulation results appearing in the center images.
* Run the script 'Localization_Simulation_3.m' in order to create the simulation results appearing in the images at the bottom.
